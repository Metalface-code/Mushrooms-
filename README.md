# Mushrooms-

# In this dataset we were attempting to find which mushrooms were safe for consumption

# Here is 3 reasons I loved working with this data
### 1. This is actually a fairly simple dataset to work with because it starts off clean with no duplicates or missing values
### 2. Everything was an object so this was really fun given the flexibility of the data
### 3. The subject matter was very interesting and could be used to truly help in different areas of business and science

# I used the following models to test how well we could classify the safe and not so safe mushrooms
### 1. I used K nearest kneigbors or KNN for short due to the simplicity and good accuracy for the most part
### 2. I also compared it to a Random forest classifier to see if it was anymore or less accurate
### 3. I also test the pipelins with and without PCA to see if data loos for speed made a difference in accuracy

## As seen here the model was very accurate give the perfect ratio of true values

# In the end I found that 
###  1. Due to the type of data in this classification and how simple it is the PCA didnt make much of a difference since the size of the dataset is not super huge the time it took to run was also not much different
### 2. This model of this data set would seem to be a good fit in production if you were looking to study types of mushrooms that are consumable for grocery stors and even medical purposes if you wanted to start with a safe ingredient for medicnes.
